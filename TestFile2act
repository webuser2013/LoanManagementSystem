Hi Minla Hariharan,

Good day. 
I'm Saravanan residing @chennai and one of your customer existing since 2015. Due to pandamic suitation I temporarily disconnected last year from July 2020.
I have been receiving lot of messages and calls on the offers for those who needs a reconnection.
I would like to resume your service, so I requested to call back using the missed call service and I received a call from your team.


I have received a first call from your Team dated 28th Feb 2021 morning . I was asking for some offers and plans on the reconnection. 
They have informed on the plans. Finally I confirmed to choose "ACT Basic" plan Amount :820 + tax which will come around 960 (approx).
I have asked for what offer can provide me since I'm existing customer. 

I have also mentioned that I have paid the Bill for the non usage for the month of April 2020, May 20202, June 2020 (Total Amount :3500 approx). Executive has confirmed that Bill is generated on the status whether connection is Active/InActive and not based on the usages, I Agreed.
I have initally asked to less 1000 amount but refused as currenlty no offer or not feasible. Finally executive agreed to provide an offer to wavive of reconnection amount 150 and to priovide a credits of amount 250 for a trial period offer kind of stuff. Total waive off 150 + 250 = 400 INR.
I finaly told the executive to provide the reconnection in an hour and I requested to inform the executive manager to have a call on the discussion of waiver.

I got the connection in an hour, but I didnt receive a call.  On the next day 01 Mar 2021 bill got generated which was the existing plan of amount 1246.
The plan not changed which I requested and not even got credits on the committed ones. 

So again I requested to call back using the missed call service and I received a call from your team.
This is the second call and I have informed the same what was discussed earlier. Executive confirmed that manager will not call back and i told the bill got generated for 1246 but I chosen "ACT Basic" which was not reflected in the Bill. Executive informed me that, the guy who spoked with me in the first call didnt chose the plan, and hence was the issue.
So he confirmed that plan has been changed and it Will be reflected in the next bill, but I denied to refresh the bill in the current month Mar 2021. He told shall do , but I received the message "your request to change the plan is received. ref SR10353149725912. Your request will be actioned in 48 hours. New plan will be effective from the last day of this month Team ACT".

I was frustated on the seeing the message. Since I requested offer they have generated the bill of amount 1246 INR ? Executive will not consider our request on the plan changes ?
This is how the ACT business is running since day one ?

I was depressed on the service provided to me. I request you to finally offer me 1000 INR one time on this and request you to refresh the bill immediately for me to pay the current month bill.

Hope your will conisder my request and awaiting postive reply.
